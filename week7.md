## Week 6

## What did you do the last week?

To be frank (and in the hopes that none of my project members read this), I made little no no progress on the website. The reason for this, though it may be a convenient excuse, is that there was a test to pass. I knew very little Python and practically no Javascript before the test and all I did was mostly memorize the syntax and how the function and classes are written. Although I did have Java experience, most of my previous classes required only C and/or C++ and thus my Java skills relatively declined. My other CS class is going a bit better. I had to look up something called "Erdős–Rényi model" where I had to analyze the patterns that result from tweaking two variables: the number of vertices and the probability that an edge occurs between two vertices. It appears very simple but in truth, there were a lot of very subtle aspects that can really screw up one's analysis. When the lecturer said that random graphs have an enormous literature behind it, he wasn't joking. My two other classes, Government and English Literature, are going just fine. There are quite a few readings which overwhelmingly bore me. There was this one paper about the nature of the foreign policy of the Soviet Union's polity which was a chore to decipher. I was also to read Frederick Douglass, which is going a bit better but it's still 50 pages.

### What’s in your way?

I'm supposed to start working on the API implementation for the website but I have no clue how to "correctly" implement it in Python. I don't know the extent of the progress on the SQL implementation but I suspect that I should have the API work without any database for now and just send data to the front end directly. To make sure to take into account of the API call limitations, I should implement some caching in Python for now.

### What will you do next week?

I plan to start working on the website project and finish that up by the start of Spring Break. I also need to start working on my other CS class' assignment beginning this Monday. My other classes don't really need much attention at the moment.

### What’s my experience with the class?

Again, I've been neglecting on the reading assignments for this class. I think at this point, I might as well wing it in the quizzes but since the readings contain crucial information on the backend of the project, it would be a no-brainer to actually start reading. Other than that, there isn't much to say that doesn't differ from the previous weeks. The routine is mostly the same: work on the project and don't take the quizzes as if it was a game of Russian Roulette.

### Pick of the week

Most students own a personal computer. To broaden the term, I mean phones, tablets, laptops, desktops, etc. The most common setup is a phone and a laptop. However, these devices generally have small screens. Macbooks, for example, are no more than 15 inches. Phones, although extraordinarily massive nowadays, their screen size is limited to the size of a pocket. You see, screen size is important. The more stuff you see, the more stuff you can do. If there are more words of visible quality crammed into the screen, more information is readily available to you without needing a swipe on the trackpad or touchscreen. When I've made the jump from a modest sized 1080p screen to a 1440p screen, there was an enormous difference. The real estate on the screen size is just surreal. It's like moving from a peephole in a door to a window. There is just more stuff to observe. And when you can see more stuff, you can do more stuff. Although a student's wallet grows ever more tight nowadays, for a Computer Science student, a big screen is invaluable. In the five years, it basically pays for itself with its productivity boost.
