## Week 6

## What did you do the last week?

Last week, I've been busy catching up in my Randomized Algorithms class which I sorely neglected. It was mostly reading and studying algorithms and analysis. There are weekly homeworks that keep me up all night and they are quite difficult. They seem to have very little relation to the reading and lecture materials which makes it doubly frustrating. Therefore, I plan to seek some help from the TA and the professor for the homework. I have two other classes I've been attending to: Government and Literature. They are rather easy since all I did was read the required materials and pass the quizzes. On the subject of Software Engineering, I was reading up on correct API implementations for the website. Most of the APIs seem to be sufficient enough for the project's goals from just reading the documentations. However, the API call-rate leaves me questioning whether the amount was enough for the website. The two front-end coders finished up on the website skeleton code that I've introduced on a separate branch on Github. Whether or not the website template was implemented ideally makes no difference as it still looks better than the current design that is running on the website as of this post.

### What’s in your way?

There is that Software Engineering project that I would need to continue working on and plenty of more reading to do in my Randomized Algorithms class.

### What will you do next week?

I plan to implement the necessary APIs for the back end. I also need to finish catching up with my Randomized Algorithms class. By spending as little time as possible on my two other classes, I hope to achieve those goals within a week. If not, there is always Spring Break to continue working, although I have a sneaking suspicion that I will eventually end up not doing anything productive during that week.

### What’s my experience with the class?

I haven't been doing much reading for this class. I also need to study for the test which as I type is increasing my dread. I have to study Javascript and Python syntax, not to mention reading over iterators covered in lecture. I don't know what to expect from the quiz other than iterators which is absolutely reassuring.

### Pick of the week

For this pick of the week, I recommend using the browser [Midori] (http://midori-browser.org/) for general web browsing. It is a lightweight, open-source, free web browser for Windows and various Linux distros. Websites these days are getting ever more bloated with ads, images, videos, effects, and more. Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox are excellent web browsers but since they are crammed with features to support "latest and greatest" websites, they are notoriously slow and power-hungery. This is terrible for laptops where battery life and performance comes at a premium. Macbooks have Safari as an option for lightweight, efficient, web browsing, but Windows or Linux laptops don't have Safari. This is where Midori comes in to provide a modern, clean, web browser. Although there are a few sites that don't work well in Midori, but for the average user where Twitter, Youtube, Google, Facebook, Reddit, etc. generally constitute at least 90% of their web browsing activities, Midori isn't a bad choice. After all, you can just start Chrome or Firefox to fill in Midori's gaps.
