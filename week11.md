## Week 5

## What did you do the last week?

The last week, my team and I were working on the project. I was in charge of finishing some parts of the tests. I suppose in the end, everything ended up all right. Other than that, I've been catching up on my readings for various classes. I received my test results that I've took the week prior though I rather prefer to avoid that topic as much as possible. It's the same stuff as always, read, finish assignments, and review.

### What’s in your way?

This week shouldn't be too difficult. There is already talk about finals for my English class and I would need to reread some writings that was covered thus far this semester. It shouldn't be too hard, if I were to write vaguely enough, I should be able to pass by just fine. I also need to read something about Entropy for my CS class. This class really makes me wish I took a programming class instead. It would be far easier in my honest opinion.

### What will you do next week?

I plan to slowly finish migrating the front end website design and updated the changes in a separate branch on Github. I hope the others started looking into it and would help in finishing filling up the website with data. Not too difficult, just mostly copy and paste and fixing appropriate links.

### What’s my experience with the class?

The class is okay, I just don't like the quizzes. At all. I miraculously managed to pass the previous quizzes with some godlike guessing ability. The amount of questions that I shouldn't have gotten right really worries me that I'm using up all of my luck in my life. I suppose, if I just reviewed the contents of last class and actually do the readings, I suppose I should have zero trouble with the quiz.

### Pick of the week

This pick of the week has nothing to do with Computer Science, technology, school, or whatever. It's just a music recommendation because I have absolutely nothing better in my mind to suggest. Here, I'm going to recommend a rock band named Slint. It's a short lived band from Tennessee, two albums and disbanded after that. Their magnum opus, Spiderland, is one would call, an album consisting of several songs that are strung together with the same concept or idea. A concept album, so to speak. The first song, "Breadcrumb Trail" is about a boy in a carnival. He sees some booth crowded by people. He was curious and went inside only to find some fortune-teller girl wearing a hat behind a crystal ball on a table. She offered to read his fortune, so he did, but later along the way, he suggested and asked her if she would rather go on a rollercoaster instead. Thus far, the music was just drums and guitars playing. The vocals, rather singing, are just mutters, you could barely make out his words as he narrates. But once the rollercoaster scene happens, the intensity booms. The guitars and the vocals scream. The boy and girl were creeping up to the sky, saying goodbye to the ground. Then, the song calms down for a bit. The boy sees a soiled man picking his teeth, standing next to a bucket of torn tickets as the children runs by. As the rollercoaster comes to an end, the fortune-teller vomits. They attempt to leave the platform. The ticket-taker asks "who told them they could leave." It was sunset. The boy says goodbye to the girl. But he noticed the colored shadows on her face. She was blushing.

There could be multiple interpretations to this song. Maybe the rollercoaster was just a metaphor. The song never made it clear what the theme was. It's not happy nor particular sad. It's perhaps just a prologue to the beginning of adolescence, exploring adulthood and the fleeting moments of happiness. It's something to think about.
