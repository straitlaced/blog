## Week 4

## What did you do the last week?

It had been a cumbersome week for me. The reading assignments, as ever, were always keeping me up at night. The two classes, American Literature and Government aren't too difficult. Government has always been of interest to me, especially international relations. The topic of the nation-states perpetually clashing in their neverending pursuit of survival and supremacy never fails to provide countless tragic tales of rise and downfall. English began to cover 17th-18th century writing: [religious fanatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puritans) and [egotist writers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin). For as many pieces of writing there were during the days of the Puritans, there were endless Bible quotes to match. They were about as exciting to read as sitting through a Sunday sermon. At least Benjamin Franklin covered much more interesting topics such as philosophy and morals. That much I can care to read. My other Computer Science course, Random Algorithms, is not going very well. At least I have the comfort in knowing that I am not alone in suffering through that class for the average class grade is telling. The lectures were horrendously boring, so boring in fact I made sure to diligently read as much as I can from the assigned readings before the professor lulls me to a state between awake and asleep. Even then, the quiz (more like a test really) was far from easy. I spent more time looking at the packet of papers deciphering the questions than writing. Although I did have a slight reassurance that everyone else appears to be doing the exact same as me: utter confusion and headscratching. Software Engineering is really going far better. Although I have little experience with Web Development, there are plenty of resources online for me to digest so I would at least have some guidance in what to do.

### What’s in your way?

Our web project in Software Engineering class always provides me some reason to keep working. There always seem to never be enough of things to implement in a website, to the point of being quite daunting. American Literature and Government are going just fine, not much going on. My Randomized Algorithms class remains to be a nightmare. This class is making me believe that graduate school in the field of computational theory seems to be a waste of time or at least not for me.

### What will you do next week?

I plan to keep working on the website and catch up in my Randomized Algorithms class. American Literature and Government will mostly have readings to do but there is an exam for Government that I would have to study for.

### What’s my experience with the class?

This is the only class that I never have a hint of drowsiness in. The professor's manner of conducting his lectures is by far the most different of all the classes I have taken. The class is engaging, rewards attendance not necessarily in grades, but in fun and enlightening information.

### Pick of the week

One application I would recommend is f.lux. You see, the human eye is not meant to view bright white screens through the day and night. Viewing bright objects with tired eyes in the night destroys eyesight. So what f.lux does is "warming" the colors of your screen. In the day, it is bright white, you wouldn't know if you had f.lux on. But in the night, that is when f.lux warms the screen to make it far more pleasant for your tired eyes. It may seem like a gimmick, but there are [scientific basis](https://justgetflux.com/research.html) for this. It will take time to get used to but you will appreciate later on when f.lux saves you from killing your eyes from your briliantly bright screens.
