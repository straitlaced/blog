## Week 5

## What did you do the last week?

The last week, my team and I were frantically working on the project's website. Most of the time spent for me was looking at documentations and implementations on implementing an API and finishing the requirements for the website. Since I am the member that was assigned the API and back end implementation, my responsibilities were critical in the project's success. Back end wasn't near as difficult as I have thought. I never worked back end on a website but things truly never have gotten too difficult. The process was mostly reading and planning but very little coding. In the end, the website was done just in time but when we compared our website to some others, it felt lacking. Apparently we were free to choose a website template and thus I have chosen one and now added another role to my list of responsibilities: front end. It's a bit too many roles but I feel like I could work just fine. I suppose I could act as a mediator between the back end and front end since I know what is going on both sides of the website development. Neither side is abstract to me since I know exactly how they are implemented and when things go wrong, I feel confident in detecting potential sources of errors.

### What’s in your way?

Our web project takes a back seat to a list of my team's priorities. There is some time to rest but I feel that we need to move to a new website template quickly. The template has everything that the project requires and is perfect to reduce hours of frustration in the front end. But for now, I need to work on my other CS class which is quite worrying for me.

### What will you do next week?

I plan to slowly finish migrating the front end website design and updated the changes in a separate branch on Github. I hope the others started looking into it and would help in finishing filling up the website with data. Not too difficult, just mostly copy and paste and fixing appropriate links.

### What’s my experience with the class?

The class has been hit or miss on quizzes. I always seem to get one question wrong and the times where I do get none wrong are the freebies. Other than that, the class has been consistently straightforward. Python topics get covered, a bit of question role calls and interaction with other students in discussing problems or occasionally discussing website development.

### Pick of the week

One Python IDE I would recommend is Vim. Vim is a command line text editor that helps the programmer to efficiently do work. The only thing required in Vim is a keyboard. A mouse or touchpad is unnecessary. If one is using a laptop, using a touchpad to code is very frustrating and inefficient. Vim requires none of that fiddling and coding is much better off without using such obtuse device. Quite a steep learning curve though.
