## Week 7

## What did you do the last week?

The last week consisted of a great deal franticness in finishing the project. Finishing the website in a span of four days is not very fun. The funny thing is that all of that could have been avoided if I just spent just a few hours every day finishing each part of the project. Procrastination is a very tempting drug. Spending Spring Break is akin to Pleasure Island where you are under the delusion of infinite time and play but the moment the week is over, just like cold water, reality abruptly comes to doom you with some work, work that should have been at least partially finished before Spring Break. And thus due to that, I neglected other classes until the weekends where I at least got some of those done. 

### What’s in your way?

I have an exam on Monday which should be pretty fun. It's nice to be acquainted with the feeling of absolute dread throughout the entire week and knowing exactly the outcome. I just hope the professor would be giving a significant curve. Other than that, I have to catch up with some of the readings from Government and English. It's just a few hours spent catching up on the readings, not too difficult.

### What will you do next week?

I intend to get things out of my way.

### What’s my experience with the class?

I did not appreciate that Monday quiz that covers topic just before Spring Break. I found that a bit cheeky. But I suppose if I did at least review some of those concepts during Spring Break, I wouldn't possess such grudge against that quiz. Other than that, it's just a normal week of Software Engineering. Pass quizzes and learning new Python concepts.

### Pick of the week

For those of you using Windows (not necessarily for programming but for other things that other OSes should take more seriously), you may have noticed how terrible web browsers are getting, or perhaps you don't care because you are more diligent and you don't have 80 tabs open and have dozens of extensions into your browser. You see, there are two mainstream web browsers: Chrome and Firefox. Both have pro and cons but personally speaking, I think they both have a lot to learn from each other. Chrome is not known for privacy. So if you're doing something like shopping, watching videos, or blogging, there is no guarantee that Google doesn't know what you are doing. Well, there is Chromium to remedy that I suppose. But for Firefox users, some extensions fail to work because Firefox is absolutely terrible at supporting their own community. Therefore I propose a different web browser: [Waterfox](https://www.waterfoxproject.org/). Waterfox is a fork of Firefox where extensions are actually properly supported. So if you have an extension you like and it doesn't work well with Firefox, you have a Firefox clone that is even faster than Firefox and supports more extensions. Sometimes, one wonders what in the world is happening among Firefox devs.
